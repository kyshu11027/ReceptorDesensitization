# ReceptorDesensitization
Modeling ligand-receptor concentration

This MATLAB project uses a series of differential equations and uses the ODE45 function to create matrices that model the concentration of ligands and receptors in the body. 
From the data, we notice a gradual increase in desensitized receptors which is what causes desensitization to drugs. The drug being modeled in this exercise is nicotine.
